        <u><p>Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement,
        a topic sentence has a specific main point. Whereas the thesis is the main point of 
        the essay, the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph. Like the thesis statement,
        a topic sentence has a unifying function. But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesnâ€™t 
        guarantee unity.</p></u>
